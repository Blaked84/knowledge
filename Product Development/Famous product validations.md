Here are my favorite examples of âœ… idea validations.    
How founders shared their ðŸ’¡ ideas and resonate with people before they even started to build a product.    
Examples in this thread ðŸ‘‡

A landing page  
  
- 120 signups in 7 weeks  
- 50 of them started using the product when it launched  
- 1 started paying 3 days after launch  
  
The page wasnâ€™t optimizing for of signups. The goal was to learn as much as It possibly by talking them. [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DjA0ksyVsAA2rEs.jpg)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DjA0ksyVsAA2rEs.jpg)

What patterns could we see here?  
  
- The idea was clear and well described  
- Almost all of them got some audience. Joel, for example, got 1700 Twitter follower back then)  
- If you donâ€™t have any audience you can still post on HN or other and it could go viral. No excuses :)
